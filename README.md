### Reuniting America

CivChat is a chatroom made to help unite Americans. Our goal is to create a place for healthy conversations between people with differing views to allow mutual understanding and inspire cooperation among the polarized population.

## How to Use

### Installing packages

Run the command `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the packages. We advise the usage of yarn which can be installed with the command `npm install --global yarn` if not already installed.

### Running the code

To run CivChat, do the following:
1. Install packages (see [Installing packages](#installing-packages))
2. Create a .env file at the root of the project containing the following:
    ```dosini
    PINO_LOG_LEVEL="info"
    REDIS_URL="<insert URL to your Redis database>" # for example, use "redis://localhost:6379" if your databse is being hosted locally 
    ```
    *The PINO_LOG_LEVEL can also be "trace", "debug", "warn","error" with "trace" being most important and "error" being least important. If using a locally hosted redis database, use REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"*

3. Run either `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` in order to run the code.

You can now access CivChat at http://localhost:3000/.
